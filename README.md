# Movie and song quiz

## What's in this repository
This repo consists of 2 quizzes
- music quiz
- song quiz 

## How was this done?
We worked as a team of 4, which was all of our first time working in a group coding project. We learnt a lot on how to work on the same code, how to use branches and much more. 

## In the code 
We used html, css, javascript and APIs to create these quizzes. The 2 APIs are IMBD API and Spotify API.

## Status 
At time of writing, this is unfinished as we stumbled on a few hurdles to get this done in a relatively short (for a first-time group) timeline.
